## Todo

- Look at the bessel beam movie, the one with the beams interfering with each other.
Green box at the end of the movie.
- Look at Andy's movie too.

## Presentation

Gentle, scare and then save them.
Ease them into the concept.

## Leong's Presentation

Unique imaging center, that no Janelian can access.
It is built for all of you.

Think about how some of these technologies can help your studies.

### General

Numerical Aperture is the most important factor of resolution.
The image is Fourier transformed at the back focal plane the objective lens.
NA Serves as a cookie cutter of your resolution.
This is the diffraction limit.

### iPALM

A point emitter will register a tick-tac-toe pattern on the CCD camera because of the "cloud" propagating out from the point.
But there are really no single points in biology.
Instead using blinking marker we can get sparse signal over time.

Astrometry uses interferometry to measure distances of quasars.
The interference of two signals spatially separated gives more or less phase change.
The amount indicates distance axialy.

Labeling density is the draw back with iPALM.
Can we get enough labeling for what is needed to resolve the structure?
Sample interval must be at least twice the desired density. --Nyquist
Really, in super-resolution we need closer to 5 or 6 times.

Only STED can go as deep as a confocal...

### SiMView

Adding contrast is often enough to see structures.
Contrast helps distinguish between objects without increasing resolution.
Light sheet does this by only exciting the specimen that is being imaged.
Light often is used for larger samples because of its speed.
The light is scattered when further from the objective.
SiMView solves this problem with attaching a second objective.

### LLSM



## Thoughts for my talk
Colocalization is reduced with higher resolution.
Get the dispare matrix slide.
Yellow coordinates of resolution, photostability, depth, temporal.

Display one of McDoles movies for the "heat map" lineaging.
Maybe the reversal movie of the spine formation.

You don't have to be reductionist any more.
Track / measure multi-events / objects.
