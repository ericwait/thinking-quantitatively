## Main Ideas

- The power of numbers as a summary device
- Automation is key for:
	- High throughput
	- Unbiased / Blind
	- Reproducibility
- Measure features that sand-out during casual observation
	- Know what the eye and brain do to observe features
	- Don't be fooled by what might be filled in as your brain fills in gaps to support a hypothesis
- Planning for analysis during the design phase is key
	- Will what you collect answer/support your questions/hypothesis?
	- Are you going to collect too much or too little data to be practical?
- Collaboration
	- There may be people at your own institution that would love to help
	- There are others that would love to collaborate.

## Pipeline Considerations

### Data cleaning

- What is necessary to get the data into a consistent state for analysis?
	- Details, details, details... key is consistency in naming, collection, and nomenclature
- What is acceptable?
	- I thought I cannot manipulate the data?
- When is it too much or unnecessary?
	- Did I remove what I wanted to measure?
	- Did I create artificial objects that where not in the original?
- Initial bias
	- Have I optimized my datasets or biased my datasets by culling out unexpected or "unrepresentative" data?

### Preprocessing

- Why would I need to processes something before I process it again?
- What techniques are available?
- Why are some operations appropriate in one situations and not in others?
- Could I have collected better data and eliminate preprocessing?
- What versions of the data should I keep?

### Measurements

- What features can I measure?
	- List briefly measurements from the Fiji course.
	- List some more advanced techniques.
	- Encourage thinking outside the box, applying measurements from other fields.
- What features _should_ I measure?
	- Do these measurements answer/support your questions/hypothesis?
	- Are the measurements verifiable?
- Don't use complex measurements when simplistic ones will do.

### Summarization

- What method gets the message across?
	- Graphs / plots
	- Figures
	- Movies
- Ovoid information overload
	- Can the data be presented in more than one way?
	- Can the graphic be split into multiples?

### Reporting

- Methods
	- More is needed
	- Not only sample prep!
- Code
	- Open source
	- State intent of one off or widely applicable
		- It is ok if the intent is that code was intended to be used for a particular study.
		Be upfront.
		Highlight areas of code that are most relevant to help others expand and generalize.
- Conclusions
	- Would other draw the same conclusions after seeing the data?
	- Were the findings significant but not meaningful?
		- For example, two conditions were statistically different, but the differences were below the resolution of the system?
